# voisTUTOR Speech-Training-Application
## Description 
voisTUTOR is a mobile and web application which enables the user to improve their speech pronunciation by analysing their audio input. It delineates scores and graphs that are correlated to correctly uttered syllables and ones which were missed. Moreover, it also provides the expert audio output and the syllables within a phrase to help the user improve their pronunciation. We adhered to the following objectives:
1. Making a mobile application which interacts with the server and provides the user with an interface.
2. Revamping the communication infrastructure between the speech training application and backend by replacing socket communication with REST APIs
3. Constructing and managing a MySQL database for efficient data storage and retrieval
